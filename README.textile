h1. EVIL

Author: Dan Webb (dan@danwebb.net)

Evil is going to be a quick and easy tool for bringing together data from all over the web into a cunning little website.  It's going to be easy to set up, easy to extend with plugins using any web API and be a good citzen in the Ruby web dev world by being a standard Rack app that you can deploy with Passenger, on Heroku or whatever you feel like. Hopefully it'll be mountable as part of a Rails or Merb app.

To create an Evil site:

<pre><code>sudo gem install evil

evil init {your_app_root}
evil whitelist {your_openid}</pre></code>

Then point Passenger at it, send it up to Heruko or run it on your grandad's ZX Spectrum then go to /admin and get going.

h2. Planned features

  * Caching via Rack::Cache
  * Plugin architecture that makes it easy to interact with web APIs (probably based on HTTParty)
  * Simple OpenID whitelist for access to the admin interface
